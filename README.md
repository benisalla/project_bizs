# Getting Started with MyWater App

This interactive web application, **MyWater**, is developed as part of the Data Visualization course at [Ecole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/). It empowers users to understand global water usage, manage resources, and explore the impacts of climate change through innovative and interactive visualizations. Special thanks to our course instructor, *Professor Romain Vuillemot*, for his invaluable guidance.

## Project Description

### Overview
**MyWater** allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize global water consumption patterns, scarcity challenges, and innovative solutions for conservation. The application emphasizes originality, interactivity, and rigorous data analysis using technologies such as JavaScript, D3, and HTML/CSS.

### Vision
Imagine an interactive platform where you can click on a country on the map to access a detailed view featuring dynamic charts that reveal key trends and hidden connections between water, population, and climate. As populations grow and temperatures rise, water demand increases, leading to water stress. This potent combination can result in reduced availability and increased conflicts, presenting a growing threat to the sustainability of natural resources.

### Objectives
**MyWater** is designed to help users visualize these interactions in real time, aiding comprehension of their impact on both local and global scales. The application also features an advanced prediction module that leverages models based on historical data and climate variations to forecast future scenarios. These forecasts are essential for decision-makers, researchers, and anyone committed to fostering a sustainable future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `serve -s build`

After building the app, you can serve it with a static server:

1. Install `serve` by running `npm install -g serve`.
2. Serve the production build by running `serve -s build`.

This will start a local server to host your production build. By default, the server runs on port 5000, but you can specify another port with the `-l` option. For example, `serve -s build -l 4000`.

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) or the port you specified to view your app in production mode.
